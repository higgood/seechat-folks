### User Interface Overview:

1. Settings: Choose the number of research papers to fetch from the database (default 20, up to 100) and the number of papers for the literature review and research questions generation (default 8, up to 25).
   
   
2. Search Bar: Begin by entering your field of interest or prompt into the search bar. This should be a concise description of the area you want to explore.
   
3. Literature Review: After submitting your prompt, the website will generate literature review based on analysis of relevent researh papers.
   
3. Generated Research Questions: After submitting your prompt, the website will generate five research questions based on the analysis of relevant research papers. These questions will be contextualized within your field of interest.

4. References: The website will provide references to the research papers that were used to generate the research questions. These references serve as a starting point for further exploration.

5. Feedback Section: Your valuable feedback is crucial for the improvement of our system. This section includes optional questions about your background and specific evaluations of the generated research questions. Human Evaluation for Research Questions: Evaluate each of the five generated research questions using the following criteria:

5.1 Familiarity:  Rate your familiarity with the area of the research question on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 signifies "Extremely Familiar" and 1 denotes "Extremely Non-Familiar”.

5.2 Understandability: Evaluate how understandable the idea presented in the research question is on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 indicates "Extremely Understandable" and 1 implies "Extremely Nonsense”.

5.3 Actionability: Assess the actionability of the idea on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 represents "Extremely Actionable" and 1 signifies "Extremely Abstract”.
5.4 Innovativeness: Determine the innovativeness of the idea on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 reflects "Extremely Innovative" and 1 indicates "Extremely Obvious”.
